							<h3 class="mb-3 pt-20" style="font-size: 26px;">What are Dental Bridges?</h3>
							<p class="text-justify">Dental bridges are artificial teeth that are used to fill in the gaps left by missing teeth. The bridge is made up of two crowns that go over the existing teeth, and one or more false teeth in between them. The false teeth are held in place by the crowns, which are attached to the existing teeth with a special cement. Bridges can be made from a variety of materials, including gold,porcelain, and alloys.</p>

							<p class="text-justify">Dental bridges are typically recommended when there are one or more missing teeth and the remaining teeth are strong and healthy. Bridges are used to fill in the gaps and help restore the patient's bite, smile, and speech. Bridges can also help maintain the shape of the face and the proper alignment of the teeth.</p>

The false tooth or teeth are known as pontics, and can be made from a variety of materials such as porcelain, gold, alloys, or a combination of these materials.</p>

You should also avoid eating foods that are too hard, sticky, or crunchy, as these could damage the bridge or cause discomfort.</p>

					<ul class="list-check-squer mb-0">
						<li class="qualification-font"><strong>Traditional Bridges</strong>
							<p>Traditional bridges are the most common type of dental bridge. They consist of one or more pontics (artificial teeth) held in place by two abutment teeth with crowns.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="qualification-font"><strong>Cantilever Bridges</strong>
							<p>Cantilever bridges are similar to traditional bridges, but only one abutment tooth is used to hold the pontic in place.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="qualification-font"><strong>Maryland Bridges</strong>
							<p>Maryland bridges are also similar to traditional bridges, but instead of using crowns to hold the pontic in place, metal or porcelain wings are bonded to the abutment teeth.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="qualification-font"><strong>Implant-Supported Bridges</strong>
							<p>Implant-supported bridges are supported by dental implants rather than natural teeth. This type of bridge is more secure and longer-lasting than other types of bridges.</p>

					<p>The dental bridge is usually fitted in two appointments.</p>
					<ul class="list-check-squer mb-0">
						<li class="qualification-font">During the first appointment, the abutment teeth (the teeth adjacent to the gap) are prepared by removing some of their enamel so that the bridge can be fitted over them. Impressions of the abutment teeth and the gap between them are taken and sent to a dental laboratory. A bridge is then custom-made from these impressions.</li>
						<li class="qualification-font">During the second appointment, the bridge is fitted onto the abutment teeth and any adjustments are made to ensure a comfortable fit.</li>
						<li class="qualification-font">Finally, the bridge is permanently cemented into place.</li>

					"@type": "Answer",
					"text": "The choice between traditional and leadless pacemakers depends on the patient's specific needs and medical condition. Traditional pacemakers have leads, which may be more versatile, but leadless pacemakers can be less invasive and have fewer complications. The decision should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider."
				}
			}, {

				"name": "Who is a candidate for leadless pacemaker?",
				"acceptedAnswer": {
					"@type": "Answer",
					"text": "Candidates for leadless pacemakers typically include patients who need single-chamber pacing, have good vascular access, and do not require complex pacing features. They should also have appropriate heart anatomy and be at lower risk for complications associated with traditional pacemaker leads."
				}

					"@type": "Answer",

Complications are relatively rare, but they can occur, including device dislodgement, bleeding, infection, or cardiac perforation. The overall success and safety depend on the patient's individual circumstances and the experience of the healthcare team."
				}

				"@type": "Question",
				"name": "Are leadless pacemakers safe?",
				"acceptedAnswer": {
					"@type": "Answer",
					"text": "Leadless pacemakers are generally considered safe and effective for eligible patients. They offer lower risks of lead-related complications, like infections or lead fracture, associated with traditional pacemakers. However, like any medical procedure, there are potential risks and complications, including device dislodgement, bleeding, infection, or cardiac perforation. The safety of leadless pacemakers largely depends on the patient's suitability, the experience of the medical team, and careful patient monitoring post-implantation."

On average, the cost may range from ₹3 lakhs to ₹5 lakhs or more. It's essential to consult with healthcare providers and hospitals in your area for accurate pricing details."
				}

					"@type": "Answer",
					"text": "After a leadless pacemaker implantation, patients should avoid activities that could disrupt the device's positioning, such as high-impact sports or strong magnetic fields. Regular follow-up appointments with a cardiologist are crucial to monitor device function and overall health. Any signs of infection, chest pain, or unusual symptoms should be reported promptly."

However, it's essential to follow your doctor's advice on post-procedure restrictions and activity levels, which may vary based on individual factors and the specific type of pacemaker implanted."
				}

				"name": "What is the maximum life after pacemaker?",
				"acceptedAnswer": {
					"@type": "Answer",
					"text": "The maximum life of a pacemaker varies depending on factors like the device type, battery longevity, and patient's usage. Many modern pacemakers last 10-15 years or even longer before requiring replacement. Regular follow-ups with a cardiologist are essential to monitor the device's status and plan for replacements when necessary."
				}
			}, {
				"@type": "Question",
				"name": "What activities can you not do with a pacemaker?",

					"@type": "Answer",
					"text": "While having a pacemaker, it's generally advisable to avoid activities that involve strong electromagnetic fields, such as close contact with MRI machines, welding, or some industrial equipment. Consult your doctor for personalized guidance, but most daily activities are safe and unaffected by a pacemaker."
				}
			}, {
				"@type": "Question",
				"name": "What are permanent restrictions after pacemaker surgery?",
				"acceptedAnswer": {
					"@type": "Answer",
					"text": "Permanent restrictions after pacemaker surgery are typically minimal. Activities that could damage the device or dislodge leads should be avoided. Electromagnetic environments, like strong MRI fields, may require caution. Consult with your cardiologist for specific guidelines tailored to your case."
