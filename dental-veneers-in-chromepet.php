                            <p class="text-justify">Dental veneers are ultra-thin, custom-made shells of tooth-colored materials designed to cover the front surface of teeth to improve their appearance. They are used to fix teeth that are discolored, chipped, broken, or misaligned. Veneers can also be used to close gaps between teeth or make teeth look longer. Veneers are made from materials like porcelain or composite resin and can last for several years with proper care.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Veneers can last for many years, depending on the type of material used.Porcelain veneers are the most durable, and can last up to 10 years with proper care and maintenance. Composite veneers are less expensive and tend to last between 5-7 years.Good oral hygiene, regular check-ups with your dentist, and avoiding habits such as nail-biting or grinding your teeth can help extend the life of your veneers.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">The preparation for a dental veneer typically involves removing a very small amount of the surface of the tooth in order to make room for the veneer.

                            <p class="text-justify">The number of visits required for veneers will vary depending on the type of veneers being placed and the complexity of the case. Generally, veneers require two visits.The first visit involves preparation of the teeth, taking impressions, and placing temporary veneers. The second visit involves placement of the permanent veneers.</p>
